Factual question and answer response using ChatGPT based on OpenAI API [quickstart tutorial](https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart). It uses the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) web framework. Check out the tutorial or follow the instructions below to get set up.

## Setup

1. If you donâ€™t have Python installed, [install it from here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Clone this repository

3. Navigate into the project directory

   ```bash
   $ cd openai-quickstart-python
   ```

4. Create a new virtual environment (do this unless you are developing and running inside docker)  

   ```bash
   $ python3 -m venv venv
   $ . venv/bin/activate
   ```

   You may deactivate python env by:  
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

5. Install the requirements

   ```bash
   $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Make a copy of the example environment variables file

   ```bash
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```

7. Add your [API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the newly created `.env` file

8. Run the app

   ```bash
   $ flask run
   ```

You should now be able to access the app at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)! For the full context behind this example app, check out the [tutorial](https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart).
